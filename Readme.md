This is a barebones svelte-native + TypeScript project template. It was cloned directly from [halfnelson/svelte-native-template](https://github.com/halfnelson/svelte-native-template). It provides an easy way to get started with a svelte native project.

# Usage

You can get started with this using `degit`:

```bash
npx degit NicoCevallos/svelte-native-ts-template myapp
cd myapp
npm install
```

Your svelte-native app will be found in the `myapp` folder.

Once installed use the `tns preview`, `tns build` or `tns run` commands as for a normal NativeScript application.

Example: install & run application on your device:

```bash
tns run android
# or
tns run ios
```
